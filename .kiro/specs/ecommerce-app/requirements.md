# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a simple ecommerce application that provides a complete online shopping experience. The system will be built using Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend, with containerized deployment support via Docker Compose and Kubernetes (Kind cluster). The application will feature an ML-based recommendation system to enhance user experience through personalized product suggestions.
